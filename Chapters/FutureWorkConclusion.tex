Talk about:

1. Using function summaries to prove non-equivalence

2. Extend the CS-PART-EQ to support mutually recursive functions

3a. Find Sync-Unrolling by increasingly try Sync-Unrolling until step case is proved. That means it has found related calls and can be used as our Sync-Unrolling. 

3b. The main problem with our current method for finding the sync-unrolling is that it relays on CBMC unwinding which is limited to 5 (6 is unfeasible). 
maybe this could be replaced with Symbolic Execution as well.

3c. We limit our recording of the inputs to 10. How do we do it unbounded?
